			<h2>Sammy Ami</h2>
			
			<p>Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually says that in the little book that comes with it: the most popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud of that shit.</p>

			<h2>Unbreakable, Mr Glass: Sammy L</h2>
			
			<p>Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like you and me! I should've known way back when... You know why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.</p>

			<h2>Yeezy, fur Sheezy: Through the Wire</h2>
			
			<p>What if somebody from the Chi that was ill got a deal on the hottest rap label around
			But he wasn't talking bout coke and birds it was more like spoken word
			Except he's really putting it down
			And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory
			And what we need to do in the game
			Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time
			In the blink of an eye his whole life changed</p>
			
			<p>If you could feel how my face felt you would know how Mace felt
			Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
			I swear to God driver two wanna sue
			I got lawyer for the case to keep what's in my safe; safe
			My dawgs couldn't tell if I</p>
			
			<p>I look like Tom Cruise on Vanilla Sky, it was televised
			There's been an accident like GEICO
			They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
			I must gotta angel</p>
			
			<p>Cause look how death missed his ass
			Unbreakable, would you thought they called me Mr. Glass
			Look back on my life like the ghost of Christmas past
			Toys R Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash</p>

			<h2>Oh, Dammy!  It's Pulp Fiction Sammy</h2>
			
			<p>Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't give you this case, it don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass.
